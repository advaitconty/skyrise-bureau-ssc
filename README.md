# Skyrise Bureau for Swift Playgrounds
A custom version of Skyrise Bureau, built for Swift Playgrounds to show my passion for planes, that will be submitted to the Swift Student Challenge

## Building
Open up the app in Xcode, and run it!
It has been optimised for macOS (running through Mac Catalyst), however it has not been confirmed to run for iPhones, iPads or Vision Pros

## Downloading
The app is designed for Mac Catalyst, and is available in the Releases tab (as a pre-realease, so you'll have to open it manually)

## Credits
Images mostly by @fireentity and me!
